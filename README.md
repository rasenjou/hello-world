# hello-world

Hello earthlings!!!

Rasenjou here, I really like web-development, though I have some of those skills. Well, sort of.
just kidding I do know all about HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MYSQL.

I live somewhere you don't know. Better, not to ask. But I do love animes in your world. I have watched
several of them. Like it.
